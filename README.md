Local Bands Unplugged: A Data Science Approach to Musical Analysis with Tableau


## Problem Statement:
In this project, I set out to delve into the musical journey of Greek bands, with a focus on [Diafana Krina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diafana_Krina), an alternative rock band. My goal was to uncover their narrative, understand how their music evolved over time, and gain insights into the emotional dynamics of their live performances. I aimed to achieve this by utilizing Spotify's API and leveraging Tableau for a comprehensive analysis.


## Methodology & Tasks

* Data Gathering: I collected audio features data from Spotify's API, while also sourcing information about live performances from Setlist.fm and YouTube.
* Data Preparation: Cleaned and processed the collected data to create a cohesive dataset for analysis.
* Exploring the Data: Using Tableau, I conducted various analyses to address questions regarding the band's album popularity, live performances, and correlations between audio features.
* Visual Representation: I designed interactive visualizations in Tableau to present insights on album popularity trends, live performance history, track characteristics, and audio feature correlations.
* Generating Insights: By examining the relationships between audio features and album popularity, I was able to extract valuable insights into track success and emotional trends during live performances.


## Business Value

* Music Industry Insights: This project contributes to the music industry's understanding of the impact of audio features and performance dynamics on a band's evolution and audience engagement.
* Engaging Fans: The visualizations provide fans with a deeper connection to the band's journey, offering insights into emotional nuances.
* Informed Decision-Making: The project underscores how data analysis can inform strategic decisions in areas such as marketing, album releases, and live performances.

Local Bands Unplugged: A Data Science Approach to Musical Analysis with Tableau


## Problem Statement:
In this project, I set out to delve into the musical journey of Greek bands, with a focus on Diafana Krina (Transparent Lilies), an alternative rock band. My goal was to uncover their narrative, understand how their music evolved over time, and gain insights into the emotional dynamics of their live performances. I aimed to achieve this by utilizing Spotify's API and leveraging Tableau for a comprehensive analysis.


## Methodology

* Data Gathering: I collected audio features data from Spotify's API, while also sourcing information about live performances from Setlist.fm and YouTube.
* Data Preparation: I meticulously cleaned and processed the collected data to create a cohesive dataset for analysis.
* Exploring the Data: Using Tableau, I conducted various analyses to address questions regarding the band's album popularity, live performances, and correlations between audio features.
* Visual Representation: I designed interactive visualizations in Tableau to present insights on album popularity trends, live performance history, track characteristics, and audio feature correlations.
* Generating Insights: By examining the relationships between audio features and album popularity, I was able to extract valuable insights into track success and emotional trends during live performances.
